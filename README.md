## Setup

The easiest way to manage your Node installation is to use NVM (Node Version Manager). You can install NVM by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Then, run `nvm install` to install the correct version based on the `.nvmrc` file in this repo.

To install `pnpm`, the easiest method is to use `corepack`. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack#readme) to install and then run `corepack enable pnpm`.

## Local Dev

To run:

- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm dev`

and then open http://localhost:3000
